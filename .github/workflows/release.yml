          ## 🔧 Patch Release: v2.4.1

          This patch release adds comprehensive automatic connection retry logic with exponential backoff to prevent failures during long-running operations when database connections drop unexpectedly.

          ### 🐛 Bug Fixes

          **Automatic Connection Retry for Direct Database Connections (#119)**
          - Database connections that drop during long operations now automatically retry instead of failing
          - Prevents "Connection error: connection closed" errors during `init`, filtered copy, and schema introspection
          - Applies to: database discovery, creation, filtered table copy, column queries, wal_level checks
          - Maximum 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
          - Clear logging shows retry attempts and remaining retries

          **Technical Details (#119):**
          - Exported `connect_with_retry()` function from postgres module
          - Replaced `connect()` with `connect_with_retry()` in 9 critical locations
          - Uses existing exponential backoff implementation

          **Automatic Retry for External PostgreSQL Commands (#120)**
          - External subprocess commands (psql, pg_restore, pg_dump, pg_dumpall) now retry on connection failures
          - Prevents failures during long-running dump/restore operations (5+ minutes)
          - All dump and restore operations protected with retry logic
          - Database connections properly scoped to avoid idle timeouts during subprocess execution
          - Gracefully handles transient network issues, timeouts, and temporary server unavailability

          **Technical Details (#120):**
          - Added `retry_subprocess_with_backoff()` utility function for subprocess retry
          - Wrapped all psql/pg_restore/pg_dump/pg_dumpall calls with retry logic
          - Maximum 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
          - Properly scoped database connections to drop before long subprocess operations

          ### Installation

          Download the appropriate binary for your platform:

          - **Linux (x64)**: `seren-replicator-linux-x64-binary`
          - **macOS (Intel)**: `seren-replicator-macos-x64-binary`
          - **macOS (Apple Silicon)**: `seren-replicator-macos-arm64-binary`

          Make the binary executable:

          ```bash
          chmod +x seren-replicator-*-binary
          ./seren-replicator-*-binary --version
          ```

          ### Upgrade Recommendation

          **Recommended upgrade** for all users. This fix significantly improves reliability during long-running replications, especially over unstable network connections or when replicating large databases that may exceed connection timeouts.
