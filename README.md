## Universal database-to-PostgreSQL replication for AI agents

Migrate any database to PostgreSQL with zero downtime. Supports PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB, and MySQL/MariaDB.

---

## Overview

`seren-replicator` is a command-line tool that replicates databases from multiple sources to PostgreSQL (including Seren Cloud). It automatically detects your source database type and handles the migration accordingly:

- **PostgreSQL**: Zero-downtime replication with continuous sync via logical replication
- **SQLite**: One-time migration using JSONB storage
- **MongoDB**: One-time migration with JSONB storage and periodic refresh support
- **MySQL/MariaDB**: One-time migration with JSONB storage and periodic refresh support

### Why This Tool?

- **Multi-database support**: Single tool for all your database migrations
- **AI-friendly storage**: Non-PostgreSQL sources use JSONB for flexible querying
- **Zero downtime**: PostgreSQL-to-PostgreSQL replication with continuous sync
- **Remote execution**: Run migrations on SerenAI cloud infrastructure
- **Production-ready**: Data integrity verification, checkpointing, and error handling

## PostgreSQL-to-PostgreSQL Replication

For comprehensive PostgreSQL replication documentation, see **[README-PostgreSQL.md](README-PostgreSQL.md)**.

### Quick Overview

PostgreSQL-to-PostgreSQL replication uses logical replication for zero-downtime migration:

1. **Validate** - Check prerequisites and permissions
2. **Init** - Perform initial snapshot (schema + data)
3. **Sync** - Set up continuous logical replication
4. **Status** - Monitor replication lag and health
5. **Verify** - Validate data integrity with checksums

**Example:**

```bash
# Validate prerequisites
seren-replicator validate \
  --source "postgresql://user:pass@source:5432/db" \
  --target "postgresql://user:pass@target:5432/db"

# Initial snapshot
seren-replicator init \
  --source "postgresql://user:pass@source:5432/db" \
  --target "postgresql://user:pass@target:5432/db"

# Continuous sync
seren-replicator sync \
  --source "postgresql://user:pass@source:5432/db" \
  --target "postgresql://user:pass@target:5432/db"
```

## Remote Execution (AWS)

By default, the `init` command uses **SerenAI's managed cloud service** to execute replication jobs. This means your replication runs on AWS infrastructure managed by SerenAI, with no AWS account or setup required on your part.

### Benefits of Remote Execution

- **No network interruptions**: Your replication continues even if your laptop loses connectivity
- **No laptop sleep**: Your computer can sleep or shut down without affecting the job
- **Faster performance**: Replication runs on dedicated cloud infrastructure closer to your databases
- **No local resource usage**: Your machine's CPU, memory, and disk are not consumed
- **Automatic monitoring**: Built-in observability with CloudWatch logs and metrics
- **Cost-free**: SerenAI covers all AWS infrastructure costs

### How It Works

When you run `init` without the `--local` flag, the tool:

1. **Submits your job** to SerenDB's managed API with encrypted credentials
2. **Provisions an EC2 worker** sized appropriately for your database
3. **Executes replication** on the cloud worker
4. **Monitors progress** and shows you real-time status updates
5. **Self-terminates** when complete to minimize costs

Your database credentials are encrypted with AWS KMS and never logged or stored in plaintext.

### Usage Example

Remote execution is the default - just run `init` as normal:

```bash
# Runs on SerenDB's managed cloud infrastructure (default)
./seren-replicator init \
  --source "postgresql://user:pass@source-host:5432/db" \
  --target "postgresql://user:pass@seren-host:5432/db"
```

The tool will:

- Submit the job to SerenDB's managed API
- Show you the job ID and trace ID for monitoring
- Poll for status updates and display progress
- Report success or failure when complete

Example output:

```text
Submitting replication job...
✓ Job submitted
Job ID: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
Trace ID: 660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000

Polling for status...
Status: provisioning EC2 instance...
Status: running (1/2): myapp
Status: running (2/2): analytics

✓ Replication completed successfully
```

### Local Execution (Fallback)

If you prefer to run replication on your local machine, use the `--local` flag:

```bash
# Runs on your local machine
./seren-replicator init \
  --source "postgresql://user:pass@source-host:5432/db" \
  --target "postgresql://user:pass@seren-host:5432/db" \
  --local
```

Local execution is useful when:

- You're testing or developing
- Your databases are not accessible from the internet
- You need full control over the execution environment
- You're okay with keeping your machine running during the entire operation

### Advanced Configuration

#### Custom API endpoint (for testing or development)

```bash
# Override the default API endpoint if needed
export SEREN_REMOTE_API="https://your-custom-endpoint.example.com"
./seren-replicator init \
  --source "..." \
  --target "..."
```

#### Job timeout (default: 8 hours)

```bash
# Set 12-hour timeout for very large databases
./seren-replicator init \
  --source "..." \
  --target "..." \
  --job-timeout 43200
```

### Remote Execution Troubleshooting

#### "Failed to submit job to remote service"

- Check your internet connection
- Verify you can reach SerenDB's API endpoint
- Try with `--local` as a fallback

#### Job stuck in "provisioning" state

- AWS may be experiencing capacity issues in the region
- Wait a few minutes and check status again
- Contact SerenAI support if it persists for > 10 minutes

#### Job failed with error

- Check the error message in the status response
- Verify your source and target database credentials
- Ensure databases are accessible from the internet
- Try running with `--local` to validate locally first

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Run unit tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

### Integration Tests

Integration tests require real database connections. Set environment variables:

```bash
export TEST_SOURCE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@source-host:5432/db"
export TEST_TARGET_URL="postgresql://user:pass@target-host:5432/db"
```

Run integration tests:

```bash
# Run all integration tests
cargo test --test integration_test -- --ignored

# Run specific integration test
cargo test --test integration_test test_validate_command_integration -- --ignored

# Run full workflow test (read-only by default)
cargo test --test integration_test test_full_migration_workflow -- --ignored
```

**Note**: Some integration tests (init, sync) are commented out by default because they perform destructive operations. Uncomment them in `tests/integration_test.rs` to test the full workflow.

### Test Environment Setup

For local testing, you can use Docker to run PostgreSQL instances:

```bash
# Source database
docker run -d --name pg-source \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  postgres:17

# Target database
docker run -d --name pg-target \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
  -p 5433:5432 \
  postgres:17

# Set test environment variables
export TEST_SOURCE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres"
export TEST_TARGET_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5433/postgres"
```

## Requirements

### Source Database

- PostgreSQL 12 or later (for PostgreSQL sources)
- SQLite 3.x (for SQLite sources)
- MongoDB 4.0+ (for MongoDB sources)
- MySQL 5.7+ or MariaDB 10.2+ (for MySQL/MariaDB sources)
- Appropriate privileges for source database type

### Target Database

- PostgreSQL 12 or later
- Database owner or superuser privileges
- Ability to create tables and schemas
- Network connectivity to source database (for continuous replication)

## Performance Optimizations

The tool uses several optimizations for fast, efficient database replication:

### Parallel Operations

- **Auto-detected parallelism**: Automatically uses up to 8 parallel workers based on CPU cores
- **Parallel dump**: pg_dump with `--jobs` flag for concurrent table exports
- **Parallel restore**: pg_restore with `--jobs` flag for concurrent table imports
- **Directory format**: Uses PostgreSQL directory format to enable parallel operations

### Compression

- **Maximum compression**: Level 9 compression for smaller dump sizes
- **Faster transfers**: Reduced network bandwidth and storage requirements
- **Per-file compression**: Each table compressed independently for parallel efficiency

### Large Objects

- **Blob support**: Includes large objects (BLOBs) with `--blobs` flag
- **Binary data**: Handles images, documents, and other binary data efficiently

These optimizations can significantly reduce replication time, especially for large databases with many tables.

## Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" errors

Ensure your user has the required privileges:

```sql
-- On source (PostgreSQL)
ALTER USER myuser WITH REPLICATION;

-- On target (PostgreSQL)
ALTER USER myuser WITH SUPERUSER;
```

### "Publication already exists"

The tool handles existing publications gracefully. If you need to start over:

```sql
-- On target
DROP SUBSCRIPTION IF EXISTS seren_replication_sub;

-- On source
DROP PUBLICATION IF EXISTS seren_replication_pub;
```

### Replication lag

Check status frequently during replication:

```bash
# Monitor until lag < 1 second
watch -n 5 './seren-replicator status --source "$SOURCE" --target "$TARGET"'
```

### "FK-related table will be truncated but is NOT being copied"

When using filtered snapshots (table-level WHERE clauses or time filters), tables with foreign key relationships are truncated using `TRUNCATE CASCADE` to handle dependencies. This error means a dependent table would lose data because it's not included in your replication scope.

**Problem:** You're replicating a filtered table that has foreign key relationships, but some of the FK-related tables are not being copied. TRUNCATE CASCADE would delete data from those tables.

**Solution:** Include all FK-related tables in your replication scope:

```bash
# If you're filtering orders, also include users table
seren-replicator init \
  --source "$SOURCE" \
  --target "$TARGET" \
  --config replication.toml  # Include all FK-related tables
```

Example config with FK-related tables:

```toml
[databases.mydb]

[[databases.mydb.table_filters]]
table = "orders"
where = "created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'"

# Must also include users since orders references users(id)
[[databases.mydb.table_filters]]
table = "users"
where = "id IN (SELECT user_id FROM orders WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days')"
```

**Alternative:** If you don't want to replicate the related tables, remove the foreign key constraint before replication.
